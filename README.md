# HPCC Systems ECL Code Challenge - Music is Life!

Welcome to the HPCC Systems "Music is Life" ECL Code Challenge!

The goal of this challenge is to introduce you to big data concepts and best industry practices, including how to process and analyze data using ECL (Enterprise Control Language) in the LexisNexis Risk Solutions HPCC Systems platform.

This challenge starts with an overview of ECL language and its syntax. You will be given a series of questions ranging from easy to mid-level difficulty to solve. 


Summary of Project log:
So basically I encounter few challenges, and since ECL is an entire new language to me. I have to learn all the syntax and understand how it works. I have to use chatGPT to debug most of the erros I am having, however ChatGPT or other AI tools weren't able to help me with ECL, since its new. There lack of resources that surrounded ECL (and they get mix up with SQL), however HPCC company were able point to the right resources that help figure this out.

Most of the time I have spend trying to debug and understand the code. Since I am working alone, I decide to take it in my own pace. I was able to learn different functions and understand how ECL interact with the given databases. I was able get down all the 1st category down in each of the challenges. I found myself struggling with the TRANSFORM and PROJECT, but was able to solve it in challenge 2. Overall, I spend around 10-13 hours straight (no break) with this. Though I was upset I felt I have did nothing so far, but I felt I have learn and obtain new skills along the way.
